bmoor - Help your code do more
==================================================

bmoor used to be about managing defining object and ensuring the loading order of classes being defined. Now, I am going to leverage es6 and webpack to take care of those concerns.  For now, it will simply be a collection of functionality I use different places.  I am looking into figuring out how to manage es6 injection for better testing, but that will be a later feature.

I am currently rebuilding it, but want to push out the basics a while.  I wouldn't use this in development.
